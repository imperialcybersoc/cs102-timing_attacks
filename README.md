# cs102-timing_attacks
The example code and full running (schedule) of the Timing Attack workshop.

## Planning Progress
I really haven't done much so far, just used Copilot to generate that chunk of code in `main.py`

## Plan

- Intro, what is time? why is it a target?
  - example of friend "lemme get my keys", time how long they take to get back, where were the keys
  - little nudge towards Spectre and Meltdown in the PPT
- Introduce the basic password-checker
  - interactive, ask them to design: check character by character, but first check length
    - maximises early exits
  - interactive, ask them to come up with a cracker design


> TODO: Design the running of the workshop itself
> TODO: Write the slides that you'll be using
> TODO: Then write the code that you'll need
